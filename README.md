## 🧩 About Me
**Who I am**

Hi! I’m Sahiti, a marketer who believes every brand has a story — and I’m here to tell it right. I believe every brand has a personality, and my favorite thing to do is bring it to life — whether through a snappy campaign, a thoughtful strategy, or a well-timed meme that makes someone smile at their desk. For me, marketing isn’t just about selling; it’s about creating moments that people remember, talk about, and want to be part of.

**What I do**

Over the years, I’ve worn many hats — growth marketer, social media manager, peer mentor — and each role has taught me how to blend creativity with data-driven decision-making. I love diving into user insights, experimenting with content formats, and finding the perfect balance between clever storytelling and measurable results. From doubling a nonprofit’s social media following with zero ad spend to crafting onboarding tools used by 300+ students, my projects are fueled by the belief that great marketing connects people, not just clicks.


**A little extra**

When I’m not building campaigns or mapping out customer journeys, you’ll probably find me exploring a new spot in the city, swapping travel stories, or busy being in awe of a clever strategy a brand has pulled off (I'm a bit of a nerd like that). I have a habit of treating everyday life like market research — breaking down ad campaigns I spot on billboards, studying how brands position themselves online, and filing away ideas I can adapt in my work. It’s part curiosity, part professional habit, and it keeps me plugged into the industry's pulse. For me, each project or activity adds another skill, perspective, or story to my toolkit, and I’m always curious about what I can learn next.
